Problems Solved
This repository contains solutions to a variety of Array and String problems. Some of the problems solved in this project include:

Sorting Arrays: Implementations of various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, etc.

Finding Elements: Searching for specific elements in an array or string using linear search, binary search, or hash-based solutions.

String Manipulation: Problems like reversing a string, checking if a string is a palindrome, removing duplicates, etc.

Array Manipulation: Solving problems such as finding the maximum sum subarray, rotating arrays, and more.


To run the solutions in this project, follow these steps:
